TSK-PDMFC-TEA-0044 Support for new URL protocol "resource"





Description

The new URL protocol "resource" will be used to access Java
resources. URLs with the format "resource:/path" will refer to items
accessed as Java resources. The "path" component in the URL represents
a Java resource.

It will be possible to use these new URLs wherever a URL is expected
in the Tea APIs.





Analysis

Simple test:

Cd to the root of the development tree.


The following will result in the error 'Problems: could not import
file "import-stub.tea"'

./bin/tsh --library=resource|/tests/lang ./tests/lang/import.tea


The following will work as expected.

./bin/tsh --classpath=./ --library=resource|/tests/lang ./tests/lang/import.tea
