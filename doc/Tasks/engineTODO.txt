  Better convertion of STeaRuntimeException to ScriptException.

- 2006-12-24 jpsl
  Understand better the purpose of ScriptContext, Bindings, and
  how it relates to STeaRuntime and SContext.
  Extend SContext so that it supports extra methods ?

  Implement Invocable.getInterface() methods.

  Tea needs to expose version information in runtime, so that TeaEngine
  may read it and decide wich operations are supported.

- 2006-12-24 jpsl
  Tea needs to allow initialization of $stdin, $stdout and $stderr
  from TeaEngine. How to do that is another issue (as ScriptContext
  provides Readers and Writers, and Tea uses InputStream and OutputStream).
