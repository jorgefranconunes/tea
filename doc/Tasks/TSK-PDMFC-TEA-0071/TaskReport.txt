TSK-PDMFC-TEA-0071 Tea unit tests API (#3901)

The goal of this task is to define a Tea API to add in the writing of
unit tests in Tea. This API will be called TUnit. It should follow the
spirit of the JUnit API.

This task will specifically address the topics enumerated bellow.

* Functions of the TUnit API available for writing unit tests.
* Command line tool for running Tea unit tests from the command line.
* Integration with Ant, Maven, Jenkins.

The actual implementation of the API may be left for a future task.



Example of a Tea unit test suit.


tunit-testsuit MyTestSuit {

    tunit-setup {
        # Run before each test.
        # Nothing to do here in this example.
    }

    tunit-teardown {
        # Run after each test.
        # Nothing to do here in the example.
    }

    tunit-test UpperOk {
        tunit-assert-equals [str-upper "hello"] "HELLO"
    }

    tunit-test-error TooFewArgs {
        str-upper
    }

    tunit-test-error TooManyArgs {
        str-upper "too" "many" "args"
    }

    tunit-test-error InvalidArgType {
        str-upper 1
    }

}





Analysis


Concepts and entities

TestSuit

Attributes:

* Name.

* Test tear down function.
* List of unit tests.

* Set test set up block.
* Set test tear down block.
* Add test case.
* Run all test cases.
* Run one test case.


TestCase

Attributes:

* Name
* Test case block.

Actions:

* Run test case.





Command line tool for running unit tests.

tunit [file-path ...]

Runs all the test suits in the files given as arguments. Writes to
stdout information on the test suits and tests as they are run.


tunit runAllTests [option ...] [file-path ...]

tunit runTestSuit [option ...] test-suit-name [file-path ...]

tunit runOneTest [option ...] test-suit-name test-name [file-path ...]


Common options:

--dir=PATH

Path of directory where Tea source files with tests will be searched
for. The names of the Tea source files that get executed are defined
by the "--pattern" option.


--pattern=REGEXP

Regexp specifying the files that will be executed for tests. This
option is relevant only when the "--dir" option is also specified. Be
default it will assume the value ".*Test.tea".
