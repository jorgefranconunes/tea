The classes in this package implement <code>javax.script.*</code>
interfaces to support the Tea scripting language, as specified by JSR-223.
This documentation shows which methods are (or are not) implemented
and informs about any features extending the standard.

<p>For more information about the standard API concepts,
please see JSR-223 or the javadoc of Java 1.6 API

The Tea documentation package contains a file named
<a href="../../../../../engineProgGuide.html">engineProgGuide.html</a> which is based
on the examples of the original
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/scripting/programmer_guide/index.html">Java Scripting Programmer's Guide</a>,
but adapted to the Tea language.</p>
